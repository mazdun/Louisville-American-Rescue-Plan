## Child Care

Reliable access to child care in Louisville is vital to a healthy and inclusive economy. By some estimates, as many as 100,000 women in Kentucky stopped working during the pandemic because of a lack of childcare options. Additionally, according to state data, 9% of Louisvilleâ€™s licensed child care centers closed between March 2020 and November 2021. 

**ARP Spending Recommendation:** $7.5M to provide childcare and early learning projects to address immediate COVID needs, expand access to childcare and early learning, improve quality and mitigate COVID related developmental delays. (Office of the Mayor)

### GLP Data Story

GLP will explore what, specifically, is included in the $7.5M allocation for child care and link additional data sources to round out the story.

``` {r child care}

childcare_tree <- suppressWarnings(read.csv('intermediate_data/childcare.csv'))

#install.packages("collapsibleTree")
library(collapsibleTree) 

childcare_plot <- collapsibleTree(childcare_tree, 
                     c("category", "topic","description"),
                     root=" ",
                     height = 250,
                     fill = "#00acbb",
                     zoomable=FALSE)

childcare_plot
```

### Additional Data Context {.tabset}

#### New Zoning Regulations
Family child care homes can now operate in all residential areas, under certain conditions. Large child care centers can now operate in certain residential and industrial zones (instead of only commercial ones), under certain conditions. 

**Deliverable:** GLP would visualize the expansion in potential child care access, juxtaposed against certain economic data.

Data Sources: [WFPL](https://wfpl.org/city-aims-to-expand-access-to-child-care-facilities-by-loosening-zoning-restrictions/), [Louisville Open Data](https://data.louisvilleky.gov/dataset/jefferson-county-ky-zoning-0)

#### Proximity to Jobs
Child care is tightly interwoven with labor force participation and other labor force outcomes. Louisville saw a large exodus of women from the labor force as child care options dwindled. 

**Deliverable:** GLP would visualize Louisville's job hot spots and compute the potential distances to child care.

## Youth Development

A sizable portion of the Healthy Neighborhoods round of ARP spending will go toward youth development. Responding to this spending, GLP will explore, through various data sources, how Louisville's kids in the 10-24 age range fare. 

**ARP Spending Recommendation:** $8.5M in funding for a three year comprehensive and accessible Youth Development System for Louisville Youth (10-24) to access a variety of services and programs and improve public safety. (Office of Safe & Healthy Neighborhoods)

### GLP Data Story

GLP will explore what, specifically, is included in the $8.5M allocation for youth development and link additional data sources to round out the story.

``` {r youth development}

youth_development_tree <- suppressWarnings(read.csv('intermediate_data/youth_development.csv'))

#install.packages("collapsibleTree")
library(collapsibleTree) 

childcare_plot <- collapsibleTree(youth_development_tree, 
                     c("category", "topic","description"),
                     root=" ",
                     height = 250,
                     fill = "#f28123",
