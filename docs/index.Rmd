## <span style="color: #00acbb;">Child Care</span>

Reliable access to child care in Louisville is vital to a healthy and inclusive economy. By some estimates, as many as 100,000 women in Kentucky stopped working during the pandemic because of a lack of childcare options. Additionally, according to state data, 9% of Louisville’s licensed child care centers closed between March 2020 and November 2021. 

**ARP Spending Recommendation:** $7.5M to provide childcare and early learning projects to address immediate COVID needs, expand access to childcare and early learning, improve quality and mitigate COVID related developmental delays. (Office of the Mayor)

### GLP Data Story

GLP will explore what, specifically, is included in the $7.5M allocation for child care and *link additional data sources* (see below) to round out the story.

``` {r child care}

childcare_tree <- suppressWarnings(read.csv('intermediate_data/childcare.csv'))

#install.packages("collapsibleTree")
library(collapsibleTree) 

childcare_plot <- collapsibleTree(childcare_tree, 
                     c("category", "topic","description"),
                     root=" ",
                     height = 250,
                     fill = "#00acbb",
                     zoomable=FALSE)

childcare_plot
```

### Additional Data Context {.tabset}

#### New Zoning Regulations
Family child care homes can now operate in all residential areas, under certain conditions. Large child care centers can now operate in certain residential and industrial zones (instead of only commercial ones), under certain conditions. 

**Deliverable:** GLP will visualize the expansion in potential child care access, juxtaposed against certain economic data.

Data Sources: [WFPL](https://wfpl.org/city-aims-to-expand-access-to-child-care-facilities-by-loosening-zoning-restrictions/), [Louisville Open Data](https://data.louisvilleky.gov/dataset/jefferson-county-ky-zoning-0)

![](images/zones.png)

#### Proximity to Jobs
Child care is tightly interwoven with labor force participation and other labor force outcomes. Louisville saw a large exodus of women from the labor force as child care options dwindled. 

**Deliverable:** GLP will visualize Louisville's job hot spots and compute the potential distances to child care.

## <span style="color: #00acbb;">Youth Development</span>

A sizable portion of the Healthy Neighborhoods round of ARP spending will go toward youth development. Responding to this spending, GLP will explore, through various data sources, how Louisville's kids in the 10-24 age range fare. 

**ARP Spending Recommendation:** $8.5M in funding for a three year comprehensive and accessible Youth Development System for Louisville Youth (10-24) to access a variety of services and programs and improve public safety. (Office of Safe & Healthy Neighborhoods)

### GLP Data Story

GLP will explore what, specifically, is included in the $8.5M allocation for youth development and *link additional data sources* (see below) to round out the story.

``` {r youth development}

youth_development_tree <- suppressWarnings(read.csv('intermediate_data/youth_development.csv'))

#install.packages("collapsibleTree")
library(collapsibleTree) 

youth_development_plot <- collapsibleTree(youth_development_tree, 
                     c("category", "topic","description"),
                     root=" ",
                     height = 250,
                     fill = "#00acbb",
                     zoomable=FALSE)

youth_development_plot
```

### Additional Data Context {.tabset}

#### Kids Entering Detention Centers
Some kids and teens who are awaiting sentencing are required to stay at youth detention centers where they receive education and medical care. 

**Deliverable:** GLP will analyze the number of kids who stay at these centers (by race and gender) and how long they stay there.

Data Sources: [Louisville Open Data](https://data.louisvilleky.gov/dataset/youth-detention-services); Data only available 2017-2019.

#### Suicide Rates
Generally, nationwide, rates of suicide and self harm are on the rise among young people. Louisville has seen the same trends. 

**Deliverable:** GLP will analyze the rate of suicide and self harm in Louisville.

Data Sources: The Jefferson County Coroner’s Office maintains this data. The [Kentucky Center for Investigative Reporting](https://kycir.org/2021/10/29/youth-suicides-on-the-rise-in-louisville/) has already obtained this data from the coroner's office through a public information request. GLP should be able to obtain this already-compiled data easily through the same method. 

#### Drug Overdoses

**Deliverable:** Through the same methodology used to determine suicide rates, GLP will request drug-related death data from the Jefferson County Coroner's Office.

## <span style="color: #00acbb;">Libraries</span>

Libraries play an important role in any community, from giving people a place to escape extreme weather to providing reliable internet access and useful personal and career development programs. The Healthy Neighborhoods plan allocates a sizeable chunk of money to Louisville's libraries.

**ARP Spending Recommendation:** \$8M to renovate and expand the Main Louisville Free Public Library. \$5M to open a new library branch in the Fern Creek area. \$800K to renovate and expand the Portland Library. \$800K to renovate and restore services to the Parkland Library. (Louisville Free Public Library)

### GLP Data Story

GLP will visualize these allocations and *link additional data sources* (see below) to round out the story and determine how important libraries are to the community.

``` {r libraries}

libraries_tree <- suppressWarnings(read.csv('intermediate_data/libraries.csv'))

#install.packages("collapsibleTree")
library(collapsibleTree) 

library_plot <- collapsibleTree(libraries_tree, 
                     c("category", "topic","description"),
                     root=" ",
                     height = 250,
                     fill = "#00acbb",
                     zoomable=FALSE)

library_plot
```

### Additional Data Context {.tabset}

#### Libraries and Internet Access
For some, libraries are the only free and safe place to access the internet. 

**Deliverable:** GLP will lean on the data previously analyzed in its Path Forward report and visualize Louisville's libraries juxtaposed against internet access. 

#### Other library data
With more funding allocated for libraries, it is helpful to see what people use their public libraries for.

**Deliverable:** GLP will analyze a number of county-level library statistics (program attendance, internet and technology usage, etc.) that are available from the early 2000s onward.

## <span style="color: #00acbb;">Affordable Housing</span>

Louisville has allocated tens of millions of dollars to reduce the number of people experiencing homelessness.

**ARP Spending Recommendation:** \$40M for an affordable housing trust fund expected to fund between 200 and 250 housing units for people at 30% of the area median income. \$32M to increase the capacity of permanent supportive housing by 200 units. \$1.5M for an outdoor safe space with about 50 tents and other facilities. \$7.5M for renovations to the College Street property (ultimately to replace the outdoor safe space). \$4M to expand an existing downpayment assistance program and help 160 new homeowners. \$4M in funding to an existing home repair program. (Office of Resilience & Community Services; Develop Louisville)

### GLP Data Story

GLP will visualize these allocations for others to clearly understand how Louisville proposes spending the money. A major theme that emerges from the data is the extreme shortage of housing units across the city. For example, it's estimated that Louisville needs about 31,000 housing units to fully meet the needs of those living with incomes at 30% of the area median income. This spending allocation would provide only 250 more units, in the best case scenario. 

There is no shortage of data sources in Louisville illustrating this housing gap. (See the [Housing Needs Assessment (HNA)](https://louisvilleky.gov/government/housing/housing-needs-assessment) released periodically by Louisville’s Office of Housing and the Louisville Affordable Housing Trust Fund.

GLP will expand on this data, visualizing the most recent estimates, and *link additional data sources* (see below) to round out the story.

``` {r affordable housing}

housing_tree <- suppressWarnings(read.csv('intermediate_data/affordable_housing.csv'))

#install.packages("collapsibleTree")
library(collapsibleTree) 

housing_plot <- collapsibleTree(housing_tree, 
                     c("category", "topic","description"),
                     root=" ",
                     height = 250,
                     fill = "#00acbb",
                     zoomable=FALSE)
